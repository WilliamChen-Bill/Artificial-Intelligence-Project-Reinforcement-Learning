Sure, here's how you can rewrite the project description into a README.md for your GitHub repository in a first-person tone:

# Artificial Intelligence Project: Reinforcement Learning

Welcome to my reinforcement learning project! Here, I've implemented Q-Learning using the FrozenLake-v1 environment from OpenAI gym. 

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to set up a virtual environment. Here's how you can do it:

1. Download the starter code, which consists of two files: `Q-Learning.py` and `tests.py`.
2. Create and activate your virtual environment with the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate
```

3. Once you've activated your environment, install the necessary dependencies with these commands:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install torch==1.11.0 torchvision==0.12.0 torchaudio==0.11.0
pip install gym==0.23.1 pygame==2.1.2
```

Now, you should have a virtual environment that's fully compatible with the skeleton code.

## Q-Learning

In this project, I've used the FrozenLake-v1 environment from OpenAI gym. The agent can move in the cardinal directions, but isn't guaranteed to move in the direction it chooses. The agent gets a reward of 1 when it reaches the tile marked G, and a reward of 0 in all other settings. You can read more about FrozenLake-v1 [here](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/).

For each sampled tuple (s,a,r,s′,done), the update rule for Q-learning is:

```
Q(s,a)←Q(s,a)+α[r+γmaxa′Q(s′,a′)−Q(s,a)]
```

The agent acts according to an epsilon-greedy policy. In this equation, α is the learning rate hyper-parameter, and γ is the discount factor hyper-parameter.

## OpenAI gym Environment

I've used several OpenAI gym functions to operate the gym environment for reinforcement learning. Here are some important functions:

- `env.step(action)`: Given that the environment is in states, step takes an integer specifying the chosen action, and returns a tuple of the form (s,r,done,info).
- `env.reset()`: Resets the environment to its initial state, and returns that state.
- `env.action_space.sample()`: Samples an integer corresponding to a random choice of action in the environment’s action space.
- `env.action_space.n`: This is an integer corresponding to the number of possible actions in the environment’s action space.
